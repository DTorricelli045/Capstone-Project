      <h2>About World Wide Widget</h2>
      <p>Our company was founded by two ordinary people with a vision to impact the world. Interested in the environment, they wanted to find a needed field to help clean up the environment and decided to focus on E-waste. Our hearts decided to be devoted into
      helping reducing E-waste and came up with a way to conquor our mission. Our services include taking in donations and salvaging used parts to give them a second chance. Millions of tons of parts are being incorrectly disposed each year and together we plan
      to demonstrate the correct way to dispose and reuse parts and electronics without damaging our ecosystem. </p>

      <h3>How does your company help the environment?</h3>
      <img class="quote2" src="pics/Quote.png" alt="quote">
      <p class="answer1">We help the environment by providing our services to
      take unused parts off your hands and give reusable parts a second chance at
      life. Not all parts are useless, but we can provide services to correctly dispose dead parts for you. You should never throw away anything electronic
      related or E-waste will become more active and spread poisoness toxins
      that harm not only animals, but humanity. </p>

      <h3>How is E-waste a problem?</h3>
      <img class="quote2" src="pics/Quote.png" alt="quote">
      <p class="answer2"> E-waste is more of a common problem than people think. As technology becomes more advanced, more toxic materials are eligible to be part of the E-waste problem. Old technology shouldn't be thrown away but reused
      or, if not possible to reuse them, dispose unusable parts correctly.

      <h3>How can I join the movement?</h3>
      <img class="quote2" src="pics/Quote.png" alt="quote">
      <p class="answer3"> The little steps you could do at home is gather up old
        parts and pieces that are unused and make sure to not dispose anything
        electronic in the trash. We come into the picture by getting rid
       of the old electronic clutter for you and make sure that they are not being trashed, but being given a chance to be used again.</p>
